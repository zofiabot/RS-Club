make bot run in debug [DONE] - (with o_redstar.py instedd of m_redstar.py)
move the bot as it is (more or less) to dashboard and run single-star instances in appropriate channels
add buddy functionality (join with a buddy or 2 - +1, +2)
checking queue against selected stars i.e. can't join not sellected star (with error message) - I think it is already coded in, but we need to check [Done]
checking queue add against negative tags given by mods like @noRS[x] for those who repeatedly proven they can't handle RS[x] [almost done]
in the future (not needed for launch) positive rating system (to be figured out, like giving a star as a thank you after run)
some frontend stuff I'll explain once we work together [mostly done]


Priorities:
1,2,3,4 have to happen before launch along with minor stuff from 7
5 is first to workk on after launch 

Stuff from 7:
A. If possible !rules command should grab the message in rules and display it [DONE]
B. help should have it's (timed delete) embed with reaction flags :flag_gb: :flag_es: :flag_ru: :flag_hk: (extendable - text values in Params or separate lang file - however you prefer)
C. delete previous embeds on init [done]
D. review 'code' messages (pings, icon) [done]
E. Help and Rules embeds don't auto-delete
F. rework stats to include weekly stats
G. add a switch for title and icon in queue embed [done]
H. don't delete 4/4 [DONE]
J. 





/me: I am disorthographic and spellcheck does not work here :blush:


ok so I don't see it directly above, but I added the code to check that you have the correct role before you can join the queue

We need to get version control working, that will probably be the next thing I do... cause this is madness.  you asking me to "zip" you it is pure insanity
